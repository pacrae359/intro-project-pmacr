## Fork

Please fork this repo before you start work. When you have completed your project we would like you to present your work.

## Tasks

Some tasks - choose as many or as few as you would like to complete.

1. Add some tests - a test suite such as Mocha will require adding. The Node backend functions require testing as well as front end functions. / Completed some testing.
2. The person table needs to be completed - at the very least complete the edit function. / Edit completed, Delete Completed.
2. Convert the backend to use a non-volatile data store - a simple option would be to build in support for SQLite to save data to a database. / Done.
3. We need to add further elements - Landlords and Buildings. Buildings require Rooms. // Not one this one. Maybe do after given in!
4. Consider the UI - can it be improved - what would you suggest? // Added some Bootstrap styling, but I would rather have had a bigger overhaul.

## Gotchas

1. Style matters.
2. ESlint and Javascript checking are enabled in this project for VScode - keep an eye on this (you can check for linting errors by running ``` npx eslint index.js ``` ). // Done ESlint pretty extensively.
3. Show us your git etiquette. // Make sure to work on branches, commit any new changes to keep work safe.
