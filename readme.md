## Fork

Please fork this repo before you start work. When you have completed your project we would like you to present your work.

## Tasks

Some tasks - choose as many or as few as you would like to complete.

1. Add some tests - a test suite such as Mocha will require adding. The Node backend functions require testing as well as front end functions. / Imported the libraries but not started on this yet.
2. The person table needs to be completed - at the very least complete the edit function. / Edit completed, Next up Delete.
2. Convert the backend to use a non-volatile data store - a simple option would be to build in support for SQLite to save data to a database. / Done.
3. We need to add further elements - Landlords and Buildings. Buildings require Rooms.
4. Consider the UI - can it be improved - what would you suggest?

## Gotchas

1. Style matters.
2. ESlint and Javascript checking are enabled in this project for VScode - keep an eye on this (you can check for linting errors by running ``` npx eslint index.js ``` ).
3. Show us your git etiquette.
